# Boyd Bot!
This is the newest installment of the Boyd Bot Trilogy
This repo contains a lot of material from the prior Boyd-Bot and Boyd-2
repo's.
The reason I created this new repo instead of updating the old ones was
because I effectively merged the two and wanted to do some cleaning and
frankly it was just easier to start anew than it was to deal with the mess I
had made for myself. I plan to continue what dev I do on Boyd from here now that I
don't plan to use IRC going forward.
